Professor Adelstein was granted tenure and promotion. In addition, she won a sabbatical and will be focusing on her research in the spring and fall semesters of 2022. Her sabbatical is over the calendar (rather than academic) year because she was on parental leave Fall 2021 to take care of her new daughter, Elira Mei.
