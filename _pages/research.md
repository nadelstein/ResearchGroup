We use first-principles molecular dynamics codes and classical or machine learning force fields to simulate and understand ion diffusion in solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. The codes we utilize are VASP, Quantum Espresso, LAMMPS, and Gaussian. We collaborate with SFSU Professor Jingjing Qiu to study oxygen evolution catalysts and with SFSU Professor Misty Kuhn to understand acetylation of lysine residues in E. Coli proteins. We have collaborated with SJSU Professor Dahyun Oh to study novel anode materials for Li-ion batteries. 

We are always looking for new Master's and undergraduate research students to join the group, so please contact Professor Adelstein if interested. Qualifications are only two semesters of general chemistry and an interest in learning Python and to work on renewable energy research. 

In addition, please contact Professor Adelstein if you would like a pdf of any of her papers or access to scripts used to analyze diffusion in molecular dynamics simulations. Included after the list of publications are links to posters presented by students at conferences.
